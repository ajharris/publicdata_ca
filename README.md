# publicdata_ca
publicdata_ca is a lightweight Python package for discovering, resolving, and downloading Canadian public datasets. It automates StatsCan table retrieval, handles CMHC landing-page churn, enforces reproducible file layouts, and generates manifests so downstream analyses fail fast when data is missing.
